Title:
Building and Integrating a Chatbot with Dialogflow and ChatGPT3
Instructor:
M. Inzamam Malik (https://github)
Objective:
ChatGPT is a new kind of AI as a Service (AIaaS) which is gaining significant traction. In the foreseeable future, only large corporations will be responsible for creating their own AI models, while smaller entities will rely on pre-trained, general-purpose models such as ChatGPT. As an AI developer and chatbot expert, I opine that while ChatGPT may not yet be at the peak of its potential, it is poised to make substantial progress in the near future.
This course will offer comprehensive insights not only on ChatGPT APIs but also provide guidance on how such new forms of AI can be utilized by application developers. With the ChatGPT gold rush already underway, the ultimate aim of this course is to equip participants with the necessary skills to become part of this technological revolution.
Outline:

1. Introduction to ChatGPT and the ChatGPT gold rush
2. Introduction to the OpenAI Completion Model and Completion Endpoint
3. Introduction to the OpenAI Playground
4. Designing a better prompt
5. Using ChatGPT in your apps for classification, generation, transformation, translation, and conversion
6. Building chatbots on top of ChatGPT3
7. Supercharging Dialogflow chatbots with ChatGPT webhook
8. Assembling and uploading training data into ChatGPT
9. Fine-tuning techniques
10. Introduction to the JSONL document
11. Introduction to OpenAI CLI tools
12. Building your own fine-tuned model
13. Entity extraction
14. Introduction to hyperparameters
15. Using existing fine-tuned models
16. Further fine-tuning on existing fine-tuned models
17. Validating fine-tuned models for weight and biases.
    Note: this syllabus is part of a bigger syllabus, infact it will be added at the end of existing chatbot course, a course that focuses on dialogflow.

#### Weak 4 :

Whisper API is a breakthrough, press is talking about chatgpt4 but it not released yet.
Whisper is real and I have used it it is far far better then google speech to text it understand sentences that has two languages in it, previously you had to download the model and run on your machine with 64gb ram memory but now you just have to pay as you go.
Ai as a service is the future of Ai
